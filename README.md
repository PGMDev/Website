# PGM Documentation Website [![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/730855489767997511?color=blue&label=discord&logo=discord)](https://discord.gg/pEEcwTk)

Source for the official [PGM plugin](https://github.com/PGMDev/PGM) documentation, using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).

## Overview

This website aims to be a direct successor to the oldÂ [XML Documentation website](https://github.com/OvercastNetwork/docs.oc.tc), and much of its content will be inherited. Ever since the original PGM project went open source, the current iteration has seen some increasing disparities. This website aims to widen the scope and introduce more materials, ranging from map and XML documentation to PGM's features, to development processes for contributing features to PGM. As such, this website is designed not only for individual server administrators and map developers but also for contributors to the PGM project and its community at large.
