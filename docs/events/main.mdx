**Events** is the official PGM plugin for managing PvP matches in a competitive setting. Team joining is disabled for everyone, and upon joining or cycling, all players on the match's registered teams are forced onto their respective, defined-in-config teams.

The plugin also manages cycling and starting matches as well as readying teams. Maps played in a match can be customized using a format file. Customizable vetos are also supported.

### Running

1. Once you download Events from the [Downloads](/downloads) page, make sure that PGM is loaded and all your maps are present under the `maps` folder.

2. Ensure that `plugins/Events/teams/` contains all the teams playing in this tournament and `plugins/Events/formats/` contains the formats for this tournament. You can find more information on how to create both in this section.

3. Register each team playing with /tm register `<team>`

4. Start the format with /tm create `<format>` where `<format>`.xml is a valid file in plugins/Ingame/formats

You will find more information about the plugin's commands in the `Commands` section. There is only one value to be configured, which is `observers-must-ready`. If disabled, the match will start without observers having to execute `/ready`. This is specially useful for referees, hence why it is enabled by default.

### Permissions

- `events.staff` - Allows users to run `/tm` commands (for administrators)
- `events.spectate` - Allows users to spectate matches. This applies for users that are **not** playing
- `events.spectate.vanish` - Like the above, but users will be vanished and therefore cannot interact with the game

:::caution
The plugin is still work in progress. If you wish to contribute to its development,
