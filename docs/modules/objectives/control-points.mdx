title: Control Points
---

Control points give a certain amount of points to the team currently holding it.
Once a team has captured all points,
or reached a certain score (using the [score module](/docs/modules/objectives/scoring)) the match ends.
Control points can be mixed with and used in addition to other gamemodes.
Other uses of control points include unlocking an area of the map using objective filters, etc.

        <progress><cylinder base="0.5,22,7.5" radius="7" height="4"/></progress>
        <captured><cylinder base="0.5,64,7.5" radius="7" height="5"/></captured>
    </control-point>
</control-points>

## Capture Rule

The capture rule defines the logic used to decide which team is in control of the point.
Values for `capture-rule` can be one of the following:

- `exclusive` &#8212; The team must be the only team with players on the control point. (default)
- `majority` &#8212; The team must have more players on the control point than all other teams combined.
- `lead` &#8212; The team must have more players on the control point than any other single team.

Players who match either `capture-filter` or `player-filter` are counted when calculating the `capture-rule`.
Players who do not match either filter cannot affect the control point at all.

## Control Point Regions

Capture progress is displayed inside the defined `<progress>` region using the dominating team's color.
After a control point is captured, the `<captured>` region is also filled with that color.
The progress and captured regions must be bounded regions,
e.g. cylinders & cuboids will work, circles and squares will not.
Only the default visual materials or materials defined in `visual-materials` will be modified
in the progress regions when they are updated.

## King of the Hill (deprecated)

:::warning
The `<king>`, `<hill>` and `<hills>` tags have been deprecated.
Use the `<control-point>` and `<control-points>` tags, which work the same but
with differrent default values.
:::

KotH is a gamemode in which you capture and hold a hill to collect points.
The first team to reach a preset amount of points wins.

KotH maps use control points to define hills.
Instead of being called `<control-points>`, they are called `<hills>` and must be defined inside a main `<king>` element.
The main difference between hills and control points is what their default values are.
Default values for `time-multiplier`, `show-progress`, `neutral-state`,
`incremental` and `permanent` differ between `<control-point>` and `<hill>`.

```xml
<king>
    <hills>
        <hill name="Hill" capture-time="10s" points="1">
            <capture><region id="hill"/></capture>
            <progress><cuboid min="-5,71,-5" max="5,71,5"/></progress>
        </hill>
    </hills>
</king>
```

### Scoring

KotH games use the `<score>` module to end the game when one team reaches a preset amount of points.
The `<king/>` tag prevents teams from getting points when killing players,
this means they have to actually capture the hill to get points.

King of the Hill maps may **not** have a time limit.

```xml
<score>
    <limit>500</limit>
    <king/>
</score>
```
