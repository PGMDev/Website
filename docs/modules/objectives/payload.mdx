title: Payload (Experimental)
---

Payload has an attacking team and defending team. The attacking team's objective is to push
a minecart (the payload) to the end of the track, usually towards the defending team's base.
The defending team can prevent this by killing enemies and pushing the minecart back.

The payload is portrayed in-game as a minecart holding a colored block which changes depending on which team is
pushing it. The track must be built with rails.
The start of the track will display as 0% completion, and 100% completion is where ever the track ends.

This gamemode is entirely based off of [Control Points](/docs/modules/objectives/control-points),
so it currently supports everything that a control point supports.

:::caution
This gamemode is experimental and must be enabled for playtesting. In its
current state, Payload only properly supports Attack/Defend type payload.
All documentation here is subject to rapid change.
