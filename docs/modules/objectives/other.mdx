## Team Death-match

This gamemode uses the [scoring](/docs/modules/objectives/scoring) module to run the game for a specified amount of time, after which the team with the highest score wins.
Teams increase their score by killing players from the other team or capturing points from a [score box](/docs/modules/objectives/scoring#score-boxes).

:::note
To be able to score points for kills and deaths, the `<kills>` and `<deaths>` elements are required.
:::

```xml
<score>
    <kills>1</kills> <!-- +1 points for a kill -->
    <deaths>1</deaths> <!-- -1 points for dying -->
</score>

<!-- Time until the match ends in seconds (10 minutes) -->
<time>600</time>
```

## Free-For-All

The FFA gamemode uses the [players](/docs/modules/format/players) instead
of the [teams](/docs/modules/format/teams) module to create a team-less match.
Depending on the modules used, players can increase their score by killing other players
until a score or time limit is reached or by capturing objectives, etc.

:::note
To be able to score points for kills and deaths the `<kills>` and `<deaths>` elements are required.
:::

```xml
<players max="16" max-overfill="20"/>
<time>8m</time>

<score>
    <kills>1</kills>
    <deaths>1</deaths>
</score>
```
