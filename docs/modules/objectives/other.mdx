## Team Death-match

This gamemode uses the [scoring](/docs/modules/objectives/scoring) module to run the game for a specified amount of time, after which the team with the highest score wins.
Teams increase their score by killing players from the other team or capturing points from a [score box](/docs/modules/objectives/scoring#score_box).

:::note
To be able to score points for kills and deaths, the `<kills>` and `<deaths>` elements are required.
:::

```xml
<score>
    <kills>1</kills>    <!-- +1 points for a kill -->
    <deaths>1</deaths>  <!-- -1 points for dying -->
</score>

<!-- Time till the match ends in seconds (10 minutes) -->
<time>600</time>
```

## Free-For-All

The FFA gamemode uses the [players](/docs/modules/format/players) instead
of the [teams](/docs/modules/format/teams) module to create a team-less match.
Depending on the modules used, players can increase their score by killing other players
until a score or time limit is reached or by capturing objectives, etc.

:::note
To be able to score points for kills and deaths the `<kills>` and `<deaths>` elements are required.
:::

```xml
<players max="16" max-overfill="20"/>
<time>8m</time>

<score>
    <kills>1</kills>
    <deaths>1</deaths>
</score>
```

## Rage

Enable the one hit kill, rage style gamemode.

One hit kills will only be applied to items that have a sharpness enchantment greater than level 1.
One shot arrow kills will only be applied to bows that have a power enchantment greater than level 1.

:::info
This module must be used in conjunction with another gamemode.
:::

```xml
<rage/>

<time>8m</time>
<score>
    <limit>15</limit>
</score>
```

## Kill the King / King's Conquest

A blitz style gamemode where the team has to defend one of their players (the king) from being killed by the enemy team.
Once the king dies, the team loses. Other teammates can still respawn as long as their monument is intact.
This gamemode uses flags to select the king and control points to end the game.

```xml
