title: Capture the Wool
---

Players have to retrieve wool blocks from the enemy teams' side of the map and return to place the wool on their victory monument(s). 
The victory monument's area, where the wool block is placed, is protected by default to prevent it from being blocked with another block.

```xml
<wools>
    <wool team="blue" color="lime" location="-20,8,-75">
        <monument>
            <block>0.5,11,-92.5</block>
        </monument>
        <!-- Blue team has to place a lime wool block at 0.5,11,-92.5 to win -->
    </wool>
    <wool team="green" color="light blue" location="20,8,75" craftable="false">
        <monument>
            <block>0.5,11,93.5</block>
        </monument>
        <!-- Light blue wool can not be crafted, it must be picked up -->
    </wool>
</wools>
```

You can group multiple victory monuments from the same team inside a single `<wools team="team-id">` element; and then define that teams individual wool colors inside of a `<wool>` element.

```xml
<wools team="red">
    <wool color="cyan" location="32.5,14,0.5">
        <monument>
            <block>-60,26,-118</block>
        </monument>
    </wool>
    <wool color="lime" location="0.5,10,21.5">
        <monument>
            <block>-60,26,-121</block>
        </monument>
    </wool>
</wools>

<wools team="blue">
    <wool color="magenta" location="-32.5,14,0.5" monument="magenta-monument"/>
    <wool color="lime" location="0.5,10,21.5" monument="lime-monument"/>
