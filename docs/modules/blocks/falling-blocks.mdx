title: Falling Blocks
---

The falling blocks module is used to specify what blocks are affected by gravity. 
Additionally, it also supports sticky blocks. 
If a falling block is stuck to a sticky block it will not fall.

Falling blocks will not fall if they touch a sticky block. 
If you make a falling block stick to itself, then it will stick only if the neighbor block is also stuck to something. 
Entire structures can then be built from those blocks, and they will not collapse as long as some part of the structure is stuck to a non-falling block.

#### Falling Blocks Element

| Element | Description |
|---|---|
| `<falling-blocks> </falling-blocks>` | Node containing this map's falling block rules. |

| Sub-elements || Value/Children |
|---|---|---|
| `<rule>` | An individual falling block rule. | <span className="badge badge--secondary">Rule Sub-elements</span> |

#### Rule Attributes

| Attribute | Description | Value | Default |
|---|---|---|---|
| `filter` | <span className="badge badge--secondary" title="Can be either this attribute or a sub-element.">Property</span><span className="badge badge--danger">Required</span>Filter what blocks get modified by this rule.<br />*Also accepts regions to limit the rule to a certain area.* | [Block Filter](/docs/modules/mechanics/filters) &amp;<br />[Regions](/docs/modules/mechanics/regions) |
| `sticky` | <span className="badge badge--secondary" title="Can be either this attribute or a sub-element.">Property</span><span className="badge badge--danger">Required</span>The blocks that are sticky. | [Block Filter](/docs/modules/mechanics/filters) |
| `delay` | <span className="badge badge--secondary" title="Can be either this attribute or a sub-element.">Property</span>Tick delay until blocks start to fall after they have been disturbed. | <span className="badge badge--primary">Number</span> | 2 |

### Examples

```xml
<falling-blocks>
    <!-- make glass fall if it is not attached to wood or glass -->
    <rule>
        <filter>
            <material>glass</material>
        </filter>
        <sticky>
            <any>
                <material>wood</material>
                <material>glass</material>
            </any>
        </sticky>
    </rule>
</falling-blocks>
```

```xml
<falling-blocks>
    <!-- make sandstone fall, just like sand or gravel -->
    <rule>
        <filter>
            <material>sandstone</material>
        </filter>
    </rule>
</falling-blocks>
```

```xml
</falling-blocks>
    <!-- blocks that match the "building-blocks" filter, and are inside
         the "box" region, collapse if they are not connected to something
         made of quartz, either directly or through other building-blocks -->
    <rule>
        <filter>
            <all>
                <region id="box"/>
                <filter id="building-blocks"/>
            </all>
        </filter>
        <sticky>
            <any>
                <filter id="building-blocks"/>
                <material>quartz</material>
                <material>quartz stairs</material>
            </any>
        </sticky>
    </rule>
</falling-blocks>
