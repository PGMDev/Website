title: Block Drops
---

This module can be used to customize what drops when blocks are broken, and what the broken block is replaced with. 
It can also be used to customize drops when a block is punched by a player in adventure mode, or to change a block's type when a player walks on it. 
All sub-elements are optional, if there are no elements all blocks will simply drop nothing.

Custom drops also apply to blocks broken by explosions. 
The custom drops are reduced by 70%, just like default explosion drops, though this can be customized through the [TNT module](/docs/modules/gear/tnt). 
Blocks broken by means other than mining or explosions currently do not cause custom drops.

#### Block Drops Item Attributes

| Attribute | Description | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `chance` | Chance that this item will actually be dropped. | <span className="badge badge--primary">0 - 1.0</span> |

The `<filter>` element is used to limit the rule to particular blocks. 
If multiple filters are listed, the rule will apply when *any* of them match. 
This filter is usually used to only filter what blocks the rule applies to. 
If filters such as `<team>` are used then no items or XP will drop if the block is mined by a non-matching player, the rules `<replacement>` material will still take effect however.

Items specified in the `<drops>` element can have any of the item attributes such as custom names, enchantments, attributes, etc. 
They can also have a special `chance` attribute specifying the chance that they will actually be dropped. 
This value can range from 0 to 1, a chance of 0.5 would mean that the item will at average drop 50% of the time.

By default, custom drops will not appear if a block is mined with the "wrong" tool, e.g., stone mined with a shovel.
If `wrong-tool` is set to true, the custom drops will happen regardless of what tool was used.

### Examples

```xml
<block-drops>
    <rule wrong-tool="false">
        <region>
            <cuboid min="1,2,3" max="4,5,6"/>
        </region>
        <!-- Make iron blocks and iron ore drop iron ingots and 1 XP -->
        <filter>
            <any>
                <material>iron ore</material>
                <material>iron block</material>
            </any>
        </filter>
        <drops>
            <item material="iron ingot"/>
        </drops>
        <experience>1</experience>
        <!-- Replace mined iron blocks and ore with stone -->
        <replacement>stone</replacement>
    </rule>
</block-drops>
```

```xml
<block-drops>
    <!-- Emerald ore blocks drop ore instead of emerald items,
         with a 50% chance of also dropping a stone block. -->
    <rule>
        <filter>
            <material>emerald ore</material>
        </filter>
        <drops>
            <item material="emerald ore"/>
            <item chance="0.5" material="stone"/>
        </drops>
    </rule>
</block-drops>
```

```xml
<block-drops>
    <!-- When a chest is broken give the player the 'chest-kit' -->
    <rule kit="chest-kit">
        <filter>
            <material>chest</material>
        </filter>
    </rule>
</block-drops>
```

### Block Punching

The `punch` attribute or sub-element specifies if that rule is checked when players in adventure mode punch a block. 
A rule with the punch attribute set to true will still apply when a block is broken, to change this behavior the `<cause>punch<cause>` or `<cause>mine<cause>` filters can be used.

```xml
<block-drops>
    <!-- 10% chance that a leaf block will drop a stick when it's punched or broken -->
    <rule punch="true">
        <filter>
            <material>leaves</material>
        </filter>
        <drops>
            <item chance="0.1" material="stick"/>
        </drops>
    </rule>
</block-drops>
```

### Block Trampling

Setting the `trample` attribute or sub-element to true allows customization of what happens to a block when a player walks over it.
This can be used to turn grass into dirt where players walk, or to drop a specific item when a player walks over a block.

A rule with trample set to true will still apply when a player breaks a specified block, a `<cause>trample</cause>` filter can be used to disable this behavior.

Additionally the `<sprinting/>`, `<walking/>`, and `<crouching/>` filters used in combination with a random filter can be used to modify the chance that a trample rule will apply.

```xml
<block-drops>
    <rule trample="true">
        <filter>
            <all>
                <material>grass</material>
                <cause>trample</cause>
                <any>
                    <all>
                        <sprinting/>
                        <random>0.3</random>
                    </all>
                    <all>
                        <walking/>
                        <random>0.1</random>
                    </all>
                    <all>
                        <crouching/>
                        <random>0.05</random>
                    </all>
                </any>
            </all>
        </filter>
        <replacement>dirt</replacement>
    </rule>
</block-drops>
```

### Explosion behavior

The behavior for blocks that become airborne due to explosions can be modified in addition to all the other drop rules.

#### Rule Sub-elements

| Element | Description | Value/Children |
|---|---|---|
| `<fall-chance>` | <span className="badge badge--secondary" title="Can be either this sub-element or an attribute.">Property</span>The percentage of blocks that will change to falling blocks when exploded. | <span className="badge badge--primary">0 - 1.0</span> |
| `<land-chance>` | <span className="badge badge--secondary" title="Can be either this sub-element or an attribute.">Property</span>The percentage of falling blocks that will change back to real blocks when they land. | <span className="badge badge--primary">0 - 1.0</span> |
| `<fall-speed>` | <span className="badge badge--secondary" title="Can be either this sub-element or an attribute.">Property</span>A multiplier for the velocity of the blocks flying out from a explosion. | <span className="badge badge--primary">Number</span> |

```xml
<block-drops>
    <rule>
        <!-- 50% of blocks broken by an explosion get turned into falling/flying blocks -->
        <fall-chance>0.5</fall-chance>
        <!-- 80% of the falling blocks will be placed when they land -->
        <land-chance>0.8</land-chance>
    </rule>

    <!-- Increase the speed of flying blocks by 50% in the central region -->
    <rule fall-speed="1.5">
        <region>
            <region id="central-region"/>
        </region>
    </rule>
</block-drops>
```
