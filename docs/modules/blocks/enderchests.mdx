title: Ender Chests
---

This module allow mapmakers to have better control over vanilla Ender chest behaviors in a map.

The `<enderchest>` tag can contain any number of `<dropoff>` tags. 
Each `<dropoff>` can use a region and a filter to determine where and when items should be dropped from the Ender chest.

Dropoffs handle taking a player's Ender chest inventory and dropping it on the ground at a defined region or it can completely erase it.
This is triggered once the player switches teams or stops participating in the match.

:::warning
Ensure that any maps with Ender chests are loaded on a server using PGM version `0.15` or newer. 
Pre-existing Ender chests in previous versions of PGM are not supported and will allow players to transfer items across matches.
Additionally, players cannot place Ender chests under any circumstances.

#### Enderchest Element

| Element | Description |
|---|---|
| `<enderchest> </enderchest>` | Node containing this map's Ender chest properties. |

| Sub-elements || Value/Children |
|---|---|---|
| `<dropoff>` | An individual Ender chest drop-off rule. | <span className="badge badge--secondary">Enderchest Sub-elements</span> |

#### Enderchest Attributes

| Attribute | Description | Value | Default |
|---|---|---|---|
| `fallback` | Specify a fallback operation for when no drop-off passes the filters.<br />`KEEP` will maintain items when the player leaves a match.<br />`DELETE` will clear the content of a player's Ender chest if they leave a match. Under `AUTO`, it will acts as `DELETE` if no drop-offs are defined, otherwise it will act as `KEEP`. | `AUTO`, `KEEP`, or `DELETE` | `AUTO` |

#### Dropoff Attributes

| Attribute | Description | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `region` | <span className="badge badge--secondary" title="Can be either this attribute or a sub-element.">Property</span><span className="badge badge--danger">Required</span>Region in which a player's Ender chest content will be dropped off. | [Randomize-able Regions](/docs/modules/mechanics/regions) |
| `filter` | <span className="badge badge--secondary" title="Can be either this attribute or a sub-element.">Property</span><span className="badge badge--danger">Required</span>Filter to determine whether to drop off Ender chest content at this location or attempt the next location (if any). | [Filter](/docs/modules/mechanics/filters) |

## Examples

### Drop-off Locations

```xml
<!-- Add drop-off locations for when player switches teams or leave the match -->
<enderchest>
    <!-- Each drop-off requires a region & filter attribute -->
    <dropoff region="red-spawn" filter="red-only"/>
    <dropoff region="blue-spawn" filter="blue-only"/>
</enderchest>
```

### Fallback Behavior

If you want Ender chest contents to not drop upon a certain event, you can specify what PGM will do with the inventory.
This will also be used when a drop-off is not possible.

By default, PGM will use `AUTO` if neither regions nor a fallback preference are specified.
`KEEP` will cause PGM to maintain a player's Ender chest if they leave. Upon rejoining, the Ender chest
will have the same inventory as before.
`DELETE` will cause PGM to clear a player's Ender chest if they leave. Upon rejoining, the Ender chest will be empty.

```xml
<!-- Specify a fallback option for when no drop-off locations are defined -->
<enderchest fallback="KEEP"/>
```
