---

Every map XML file must contain the base `<map>` module. 
It contains modules that specify the map name, version, objective, authors, contributors, and all other map settings. 
The objective is the text that players see when they join the match, and so it is important for this to be very clear, concise, and informative.

The `proto=""` attribute specifies what PGM version the XML file was created for. 
Mapmakers should always use the latest supported proto version, which is documented in depth at [Protocol Versions](/docs/modules/general/proto).

The maps version should follow the versioning schema `major.minor.patch`.

<div className="table-container">
  | Map Element | Description | Value/Children |
  |---|---|---|
  | `<map> </map>` | The main map node containing all the modules used in this match. | <span className="badge badge--secondary">XML Modules</span> |
</div>

##### Map Attributes

<div className="table-container">
  | Map Attributes | Description | Value | Default |

</div>

```xml
<map proto="1.4.2">
<name>Map Name</name>
<version>1.0.0</version>
<objective>Short description about the map's objective.</objective>

<!-- Map authors & contributors. -->

<!-- Map modules, i.e. objectives, regions, spawns. -->

</map>
```

### Authors & Contributors

The authors and contributers elements provide information about who created and helped create the map. 
There can be multiple authors and contributors to a map. 
The contribution attribute should be used to specify what their contribution to the map was.

A player's name should **not** be used to credit them, instead their UUID should be used. 
A UUID is a universally unique identifier that is used to keep track of players even if they change their name. 
You can check player UUIDs at [mcuuid.net](https://mcuuid.net/). 
If an author or contributor is defined without a UUID, that player will not get any mapmaker perks on the map.

#### Author or Contributor Sub-elements

<div className="table-container">
  | Element | Description | Value/Children |
  |---|---|---|
  | `<author>` | A major author of the map, used in `<authors>`. | <span className="badge badge--primary">String</span> |
  | `<contributor>` | A contributor to the map, used in `<contributors>`. | <span className="badge badge--primary">String</span> |
</div>

##### Author & Contributor Attributes

<div className="table-container">
  | Attribute | Description | Value |
  |---|---|---|
  | `uuid` | The UUID used to identify a Minecraft player. | <span className="badge badge--primary">String</span> |
  | `contribution` | A description of the contribution this author or contributor made to the map. | <span className="badge badge--primary">String</span> |
</div>

```xml
<!-- Major map authors -->
<authors>
    <author>aPerson</author> <!-- Credit a person that doesn't have a Minecraft account -->
    <author uuid="ef4ea031-998f-4ec9-b7b6-1bdd428bcef8" contribution="Clarification of element usage, etc."/> <!-- Plastix -->
    <author uuid="260004f0-996b-4539-ba21-df4ee6336b63"/> <!-- Elliott_ -->
</authors>

<!-- People that contributed in some way to the map -->
<contributors>
    <!-- Credit a person that doesn't have a Minecraft account -->
    <contributor contribution="A contribution">aHelper</contributor>
    <contributor uuid="3fbec7dd-0a5f-40bf-9d11-885a54507112" contribution="Some help"/> <!-- Cubist -->
</contributors>
```

### Include Statements

Include statements allow for global XML files to be loaded and re-used across different maps.
This can be used to standardize values across maps.
Below is a sample includes file that can be used on Blitz maps:

```xml title="/server/includes/blitz.xml"
<!-- the location for include files is defined in config.yml -->
<map>
    <blitz>
        <lives>5</lives>
    </blitz>
</map>
```

The file is automatically given an ID based on the file name, which in this case is `blitz`.
Then it can be added into the main `map.xml`. Multiple include statements can be used per map.

```xml title="/server/maps/map_name/map.xml"
<map>
  ...
  <!-- All maps with this include statement will give the player 5 lives -->
  <include id="blitz"/>
  ...
</map>
```

### Map Variants

Mapmakers may choose to build different versions of their maps that are tailored for events, such as tournaments. 
This tool allows them to avoid the need to duplicate existing maps and, instead, unify various versions into one location.

By defining a variant ID, PGM will treat an individual map with one or more variants as separate maps. 
Each variant can contain conditionals, which determine whether a section of the XML file from the base (internally, the `default` variant) map should be loaded for a variant map.
Additionally, a variant can also contain constants, which allows you to define text constants that can be used to replace placeholders in the base map XML with the specified values.

#### Variant Sub-elements

<div className="table-container">
  | Element | Description | Value/Children |
  |---|---|---|
  | `<variant> </variant>` | A map variant. | <span className="badge badge--primary">String</span> |
</div>

##### Variant Attributes

<div className="table-container">
  | Attribute | Description | Value | Default |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | `id` | <span className="badge badge--danger">Required</span>Unique identifier used to reference this map variant from other places in the XML. | <span className="badge badge--primary">String</span> |
  | `world` | The world the variant should use during a match. | <span className="badge badge--primary">String</span> |
  | `override` | Toggle if the variant name should override the base map name. If set to false, PGM will append `: [variant]` to the base map name. | <span className="badge badge--primary">true/false</span> | false |
</div>

#### Conditionals Sub-elements

<div className="table-container">
  | Element | Description | Value/Children |
  |---|---|---|
  | `<if> </if>` | Apply an XML section if the specified variant is loaded. | <span className="badge badge--secondary">XML Modules</span> |
  | `<unless> </unless>` | Apply an XML section for all variants except for a specific variant when loaded. | <span className="badge badge--secondary">XML Modules</span> |
</div>

##### If/Unless Conditional Attributes

<div className="table-container">
  | Attribute | Description | Value |
  |---|---|---|
  | `variant` | The name of the variant to target. | <span className="badge badge--primary">Variant ID</span> |
  | `has-variant` | Target all maps with a specified variant.<br />**Note:** This can be useful in a server's global XML file. | <span className="badge badge--primary">Variant ID</span> |
</div>

**Note:** Multiple variants can be targeted as long as it is separated with a comma (`,`).

### Constants
Constants are values that remain the same, regardless of conditions.
PGM will search and replace any corresponding placeholders (`${constant_id}`) with the constant value.

<div className="table-container">
  | Element | Description | Children |
  |---|---|---|
  | `<constants> </constants>` | A node containing the constants for this map. | <span className="badge badge--secondary">Constant Elements</span> |

  | Sub-elements |||
  |---|---|---|
  | `<constant> </constant>` | An individual constant. | <span className="badge badge--primary">String</span> |
</div>

##### Constant Attributes

<div className="table-container">
  | Attribute | Description | Value | Default |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | `id` | <span className="badge badge--danger">Required</span>Unique identifier used to reference this constant from other places in the XML. | <span className="badge badge--primary">String</span> |
  | `delete` | When true, PGM will completely delete the attribute or element the constant was used in, rather than leaving it blank. | <span className="badge badge--primary">true/false</span> | false |
</div>

The following example utilizes both map variants and constant.
```xml
<map proto="1.4.2">
<name>Map Name</name>
<variant id="5v5">5v5</variant> <!-- Loaded as "Map Name: 5v5" -->
<variant id="tournament">TE</variant> <!-- Loaded as "Map Name: TE" -->
<variant id="halloween" override="true">Spooky Map Name</variant> <!-- Loaded as "Spooky Map Name" -->

<!-- PGM will replace "${team_size}" and "${max}" placeholder with the new value -->
<constant id="team_size">25</constant>
<constant id="overfill" delete="true"/> <!-- "max-overfill" will not exist when "Map Name" is loaded -->
<constant id="max">6</constant>
<if variant="5v5">
    <constant id="team_size">5</constant>
    <constant id="overfill">5</constant>
    <constant id="max">3</constant>
</if>
<if variant="tournament">
    <constant id="team_size">6</constant>
    <constant id="overfill">6</constant>
    <constant id="max" delete="true"/>
</if>

<team id="red" max="${team_size}" max-overfill="${overfill}"/>
<team id="blue" max="${team_size}" max-overfill="${overfill}"/>
<score>
    <limit>${max}</limit> <!-- 6 in "Map Name", 3 in "Map Name: 5v5", non-existent in "Map Name: TE" -->
</score>
</map>
```

### Map Gamemode

The gamemode element is used to specify the gamemode(s) of the map.
This mainly affects how the map is displayed.
If no `<gamemode>` tags are specified, the map will set the gamemode(s) to whatever modules are used.
This means that a map that uses destroyables and flags would be displayed as "DTM and CTF" unless specified otherwise.

<div className="table-container">
  | Element | Description | Value/Children |
  |---|---|---|
  | `<gamemode> </gamemode>` | The gamemode(s) of this map. | <span className="badge badge--primary">Gamemode ID</span> |
</div>

#### Gamemode IDs

<div className="table-container">
  | ID | Description |
  |---|---|
  | `arcade` | Arcade |
  | `ad` | Attack/Defend |
  | `bedwars` | Bed Wars |
