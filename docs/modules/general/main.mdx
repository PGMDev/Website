---

Every map XML file must contain the base `<map>` module. 
It contains modules that specify the map name, version, objective, authors, contributors, and all other map settings.
The objective is the text that players see when they join the match, and so this needs to be very clear, concise, and informative.

The `proto=""` attribute specifies what PGM version the XML file was created for. 
Mapmakers should always use the latest supported proto version, which is documented in depth at [Protocol Versions](/docs/modules/general/proto).

The map's version should follow the versioning schema `major.minor.patch`.

| Map Element | Description | Value/Children |

<objective>Short description about the map's objective.</objective>

<!-- Map authors & contributors. -->

<!-- Map modules, i.e. objectives, regions, spawns. -->

</map>
```

## Authors & Contributors

The authors and contributors elements provide information about who created and helped create the map. 
There can be multiple authors and contributors to a map. 
The contribution attribute should be used to specify what their contribution to the map was.

A player's name should **not** be used to credit them, instead their UUID should be used. 
A UUID is a universally unique identifier that is used to keep track of players even if they change their names. 
You can check player UUIDs at [mcuuid.net](https://mcuuid.net/). 
If an author or contributor is defined without a UUID, that player will not get any mapmaker perks on the map.

#### Author or Contributor Sub-elements

| Element | Description | Value/Children |
|---|---|---|
| `<author>` | A major author of the map, used in `<authors>`. | <span className="badge badge--primary">String</span> |
| `<contributor>` | A contributor to the map, used in `<contributors>`. | <span className="badge badge--primary">String</span> |

##### Author & Contributor Attributes

| Attribute | Description | Value |

| `contribution` | A description of the contribution this author or contributor made to the map. | <span className="badge badge--primary">String</span> |

## Map Gamemode

The gamemode element is used to specify the gamemode(s) of the map.
This mainly affects how the map is displayed.
If no `<gamemode>` tags are specified, the map will set the gamemode(s) to whatever modules are used.
This means that a map that uses destroyables and flags would be displayed as "DTM and CTF" unless specified otherwise.

| Element | Description | Value/Children |
|---|---|---|
| `<gamemode> </gamemode>` | The gamemode(s) of this map. | <span className="badge badge--primary">Gamemode ID</span> |
