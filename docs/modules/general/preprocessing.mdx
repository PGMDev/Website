## Includes

Include statements allow global XML files to be loaded and reused across different maps, thereby standardizing elements across maps.

Using the include element, an XML file can be split into multiple files and then included in the main one.
This allows you to keep the main file more organized by including sections such as kits, actions, and more.

```xml
<map>
    ...
    <include id="include-name-goes-here"/>
    ...
</map>
```

### Example

Below is a sample include file that can be used for Blitz maps:

```xml title="/server/includes/blitz.xml"
<!-- The location for include files is defined in /plugins/PGM/config.yml -->
<map>
    <blitz>
        <lives>5</lives>
    </blitz>
</map>
```

The include file is automatically given an ID based on its file name, which in this case is `blitz`.
Then, it can be added to the main `map.xml`. Multiple include statements can be used per map.

```xml title="/server/maps/map_name/map.xml"
<map>
...
<!-- All maps with this include statement will give the player 5 lives -->
<include id="blitz"/>
...
</map>
```

## Map Variants

Mapmakers may choose to build different versions of their maps tailored to events, such as seasonal maps (Christmas, Halloween, etc.).
Variants allow them to avoid the need to duplicate existing maps and, instead, unify various versions into one location.

By defining a variant ID, PGM will treat an individual map with one or more variants as separate maps. 
Each variant can contain conditionals, which determine whether a section of the XML file from the base (internally, the `default` variant) map should be loaded for a variant map.
Additionally, a variant can also contain constants, which allows you to define text constants that can be used to replace placeholders in the base map XML with the specified values.

#### Variant Sub-elements

| Element | Description | Value/Children |
|---|---|---|
| `<variant> </variant>` | A map variant. | <span className="badge badge--primary">String</span> |

##### Variant Attributes

| Attribute | Description | Value | Default |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | <span className="badge badge--danger">Required</span>Unique identifier used to reference this map variant from other places in the XML. | <span className="badge badge--primary">String</span> |
| `slug` | The variant's internal identifier, usually auto generated from the variant's name. This should only be used when a variant is renamed to retain its information, etc.<br />*Valid slugs are lowercase and only contain the characters:* `a-z 0-9 _` | <span className="badge badge--primary">String</span> | <span className="badge badge--secondary">Auto Generated</span> |
| `world` | The world the variant should use during a match. | <span className="badge badge--primary">String</span> |
| `override` | Toggle if the variant name should override the base map name. If set to false, PGM will append `: [variant]` to the base map name. | <span className="badge badge--primary">true/false</span> | false |

### Example

```xml
<map proto="1.5.0">
<name>Map Name</name>
<variant id="5v5">5v5</variant> <!-- Loaded as "Map Name: 5v5" -->
<variant id="tournament">TE</variant> <!-- Loaded as "Map Name: TE" -->
<variant id="halloween" override="true">Spooky Map Name</variant> <!-- Loaded as "Spooky Map Name" -->
<variant id="christmas" world="christmas"/>Christmas</variant> <!-- Loaded as "Map Name: Christmas" with a different world -->
...
</map>
```


## Conditionals

XML files can contain simple `<if>` and `<unless>` conditional statements.
These conditionals can be used to reduce duplicated map files and simplify managing multiple map variations.

For example, instead of having multiple map variants in different folders, they can be condensed into one location.
This also allows map variants to be automatically loaded on specific servers or during special occasions.

#### Conditionals Sub-elements

| Element | Description | Value/Children |
|---|---|---|
| `<if> </if>` | Apply an XML section if the specified variant is loaded. | <span className="badge badge--secondary">XML Modules</span> |
| `<unless> </unless>` | Apply an XML section for all variants except for a specific variant when loaded. | <span className="badge badge--secondary">XML Modules</span> |

##### If/Unless Conditional Attributes

| Attribute | Description | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `variant` | The map variant to target.<br />*Multiple variants can be targeted as long as it is separated with a comma (`,`).* | <span className="badge badge--primary">Variant ID</span> |
| `has-variant` | Target all maps with a specified variant.<br />**Note:** This can be useful in a server's global XML file. | <span className="badge badge--primary">Variant ID</span> |
| `constant` | The name of the constant to check against.<br />*Constants must be defined before this conditional.* | <span className="badge badge--primary">Constant ID</span> |
| `constant-value` | The constant value to check for. | <span className="badge badge--secondary">Constant Value</span>
| `constant-comparison` | The type of comparison performed.<br />**Note:** If there is no value, it will default to `defined value`. With a value, it will default to `equals`. | `undefined`, `defined`,<br />`defined delete`,<br />`defined value`,<br />`contains`, `regex`, `range`. |

#### Constant Comparison

* UNDEFINED: checks that the constant has not been defined to anything.
* DEFINED: checks the constant has been defined, to anything (either to delete or to a value).
* DEFINED_DELETE: the constant has been defined as a delete.
* DEFINED_VALUE: the constant has defined as an actual value (not a delete).
* EQUALS: the constant equals to the attribute constant-value.
* CONTAINS: the constant is one of the the comma-separated list of values in `constant-value`.
    ```xml
    <if constant="const" constant-value="a,b,c" constant-comparison="contains"/>
    ```
* REGEX: checks if the constant matches the regex.
    ```xml
    <if constant="const" constant-value="[0-9]+" constant-comparison="regex"/>
    ```
* RANGE: check if the constant, interpreted as a number, is in the range.
    * In this example, we check if the value is between 0 and 12.
        ```xml
        <if constant="const" constant-value="0..12" constant-comparison="range"/>
        ```

## Constants

Constants are values that remain the same, regardless of conditions.
PGM will search and replace any corresponding placeholders (`${constant_id}`) with the constant value.

| Element | Description | Children |
|---|---|---|
| `<constants> </constants>` | A node containing the constants for this map. | <span className="badge badge--secondary">Constant Elements</span> |

| Sub-elements |||
|---|---|---|
| `<constant> </constant>` | An individual constant. | <span className="badge badge--primary">String</span> |

##### Constant Attributes

| Attribute | Description | Value | Default |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | <span className="badge badge--danger">Required</span>Unique identifier used to reference this constant from other places in the XML. | <span className="badge badge--primary">String</span> |
| `delete` | When true, PGM will completely delete the attribute or element the constant was used in, rather than leaving it blank. | <span className="badge badge--primary">true/false</span> | false |
| `fallback` | When true, this constant will not override any previous declaration.<br />**Note:** This is useful for includes, since you may not want to override individual maps' constant value. | <span className="badge badge--primary">true/false</span> | false |

### Example

The following example utilizes both map variants and constants.
```xml
<map proto="1.5.0">
<name>Map Name</name>
<variant id="5v5">5v5</variant> <!-- Loaded as "Map Name: 5v5" -->
<variant id="tournament">TE</variant> <!-- Loaded as "Map Name: TE" -->

<!-- PGM will replace "${team_size}" and "${max}" placeholder with the new value -->
<constant id="team_size">25</constant>
<constant id="overfill" delete="true"/> <!-- "max-overfill" will not exist when "Map Name" is loaded -->
<constant id="max">6</constant>
<if variant="5v5">
    <constant id="team_size">5</constant>
    <constant id="overfill">5</constant>
    <constant id="max">3</constant>
</if>
<if variant="tournament">
    <constant id="team_size">6</constant>
    <constant id="overfill">6</constant>
    <constant id="max" delete="true"/>
</if>

<team id="red" max="${team_size}" max-overfill="${overfill}"/>
<team id="blue" max="${team_size}" max-overfill="${overfill}"/>
<score>
    <limit>${max}</limit> <!-- 6 in "Map Name", 3 in "Map Name: 5v5", non-existent in "Map Name: TE" -->
</score>
</map>
```
