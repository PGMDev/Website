Pickups are used to create a pickup-able kit at a specific location.
While somewhat similar to a kit applied using a region, pickups are represented by a physical object and have a refresh time.

By default, an ender crystal entity is used to show the pickup location.
When a player walks into the crystal, it gives them a kit and then de-spawns.
The crystal will respawn again at a *random* location inside the specified region after the set respawn time.
This means that the pickup's region must be randomize-able, e.g. a `<cuboid>`, `<cylinder>`, `<block>` or `<point>`.
A `<point>` region does not return a randomized position but can still be used to specify an exact location for a pickup.
