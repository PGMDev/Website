---

The shops module is an easy way to add shop functionality to a map with a GUI interface.
Players interact with mobs, such as Villagers, which are shopkeepers where they can buy items using currencies.
Shops have categories of items, and each category can store up to 28 unique items.
Players can also buy a kit, instead of individual items, or use muiltiple currencies to purchase items.
