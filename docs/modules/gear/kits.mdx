Kits are groups of items and effects that can be given to players in various ways.
here are many types of kits, and they can be packaged together in any combination.

Kits can be given an `id` attribute, which is used to refer to them in other places.
Kits can contain other kits directly, and can also inherit items from other kits through the `parents=""` attribute.

Some types of kits are _removable_, meaning that the kit can be automatically
taken from the player as well as given. When used in certain contexts,
these kits will be automatically removed from the player at an appropriate time.
These can be used in [Dynamic Kits](#dynamic-kits).
Removable kits will be noted in the documentation where applicable.

#### Kit Element

| Element | Description |
|---|---|
| `<kit> </kit>` | A kit node, containing specific kit types and/or other kit nodes. |

### Kit Attributes

| Attribute | Description | Value | Default |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | Unique identifier used to reference this kit from other places in the XML. | <span className="badge badge--primary">String</span> |
| `filter` | <span className="badge badge--secondary" title="Can be either this attribute or a sub-element.">Property</span>Filter when this kit is used. | [Filter](/docs/modules/mechanics/filters) |
| `parents` | The kit's parent or a comma separated list of parent kits. | <span className="badge badge--primary">String</span> |
| `force` | Force apply the kit, which will override existing items in certain slots. | <span className="badge badge--primary">true/false</span> |
| `overflow-warning` | Warn the player when the kit cannot give the player all of its items.<br />*Defaults to standard translatable message* | <span className="badge badge--primary">String</span> |
| `repair-tools` | Repairs tools in the player's inventory with those given in the kit. | <span className="badge badge--primary">true/false</span> | true |
| `deduct-tools` | Deducts the toolrepair given in the kit by the toolrepair in the player's inventory. | <span className="badge badge--primary">true/false</span> | true |
| `deduct-items` | Deducts the number of items given in the kit by the number of items the player already has. | <span className="badge badge--primary">true/false</span> | true |
| `drop-overflow` | Drops overflow items on the ground near the player. | <span className="badge badge--primary">true/false</span> | false |
| `potion-particles` | Enable or disable potion particles.<br />*Potion particles are disabled for all players by default.* | <span className="badge badge--primary">true/false</span> | false |
| `reset-ender-pearls` | Reset any ender pearls the player might have thrown before the kit was applied. | <span className="badge badge--primary">true/false</span> | false |

The effect of the `force` attribute depends on the type of kit it is used with:
conflicting items or armor will be replaced instead of smartly merged and repaired,
health and hunger will be set instead of only increased,
and potion effects can be replaced with the same effect at a lower level or shorter duration.

```xml
<kits>
    <kit id="spawn-kit" force="true">
        <item slot="0" material="iron sword"/>
        <item slot="8" amount="32" material="bread"/>
        <effect duration="5">instant_health</effect>
    </kit>
    <kit id="red-kit" parents="spawn">
        <helmet color="cd0000" material="leather helmet"/>
    </kit>
    <kit id="blue-kit" parents="spawn">
        <helmet color="0066cc" material="leather helmet"/>
    </kit>
</kits>
```

In the example above players from blue team will get a blue helmet,
players from red team will get a red helmet; both teams will get the items from the spawn kit.
The spawn kit contains a 5 second healing potion to help prevent spawn killing.

### Item & Armor Kits

Kits can place items in specific slots of a player's inventory, and equip them with armor. 
See [Items & Armor](/docs/modules/gear/items) for details.

Item kits will replace any items in the player's inventory in slots present in the kit, but they will not alter any other slots.
If you want to guarantee that a slot is empty, put an item called "air" in that slot. 
You can also clear the player's entire inventory before applying the kit by using the `<clear/>` element.

##### Inventory Clear Elements

| Element | Description |
|---|---|
| `<clear/>` | Clears all of the player's inventory, including armor slots. |

##### Inventory Clear Attributes

| Attribute | Description | Value | Default |
|---|---|---|---|
| `items` | Clears all of the player's inventory, except armor slots. | <span className="badge badge--primary">true/false</span> | true |
| `armor` | Clear's all of the player's armor slots. | <span className="badge badge--primary">true/false</span> | true |
| `effects` | Clears all of the player's current potion effects. | <span className="badge badge--primary">true/false</span> | false |

```xml
<kit id="ender" reset-ender-pearls="true">
    <item slot="0" amount="4" material="ender pearl"/>
    <!-- clears items and armor slots by default -->
    <clear/>
</kit>
```

### Game-mode Kit

A player's gamemode can be changed when they spawn, enter or leave a region, etc., by applying a kit with a `game-mode` element.
This is not to be confused with [Map Gamemode `<gamemode>`](/docs/modules/general/main#map-gamemode), which controls how PGM should display a map.  

| Element | Description | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `<game-mode> </game-mode>` | The gamemode to change the player to. | <span className="badge badge--secondary">Game Mode String</span> |

```xml
<game-mode>adventure</game-mode>
```

### Health & Hunger Kits

A player's health and hunger can be modified with kits, this can be useful on maps with the [`naturalRegeneration` gamerule](/docs/modules/mechanics/gamerules) set to false.

By default health or hunger values are only increased, not decreased.
For example, a player with 5 hearts (10 points) will not get a 5 health point kit applied,
however a 20 point kit will be applied. This can be overwritten with a kit `force="true"` attribute.

##### Health & Hunger Elements

| Element | Description | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `<health> </health>` | Health value in &frac12; heart increments. | <span className="badge badge--primary">1 - 20</span> |
| `<max-health> </max-health>` | The maximum health a player can have. | <span className="badge badge--primary">&gt;1</span> |
| `<saturation> </saturation>` | Food saturation, always equal to or less than the player's food level. | <span className="badge badge--primary">Decimal</span> |
| `<foodlevel> </foodlevel>` | Food level in &frac12; drumstick increments. | <span className="badge badge--primary">0 - 20</span> |

```xml
<kit id="health" force="true">
    <health>10</health>
</kit>

<kit id="max-health-kit" force="true">
     <!-- Double health, default is 20 -->
     <max-health>40</max-health>
</kit>

<kit id="hunger">
    <saturation>20</saturation>
    <foodlevel>20</foodlevel>
</kit>
```

### Team Switch Kit

Allow for players who receive this kit to be forced onto a different team.

| Element | Description |
|---|---|
| `<team-switch/>` | Switch the player's current team. |

##### Team Switch Kit Attributes

| Attribute | Description | Value | Default |
|---|---|---|---|
| `team` | The new team to switch the player to. | [Team ID](/docs/modules/format/teams) |
| `show-title` | Set if the player should recieve join message as a title. | <span className="badge badge--primary">true/false</span> | true |

```xml

</kit>
```

### Dynamic Kits

Kits that are removable can be given and taken dynamically by using a Dynamic Filter.

| Element | Description | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `<give>` | Gives a kit to a player when they match the filter. | [Dynamic Filter](/docs/modules/mechanics/filters#dynamic-filters) |
| `<take>` | Removes a kit when they match the filter. | [Dynamic Filter](/docs/modules/mechanics/filters#dynamic-filters) |
| `<lend>` | Loans a player a kit when the filter is `ALLOW`, removes when they stop matching the filter. | [Dynamic Filter](/docs/modules/mechanics/filters#dynamic-filters) |

```xml
<kits>
    <!-- Kit and Filter References -->
    <lend kit="jumper-kit" filter="carrying-gold"/>
    <give kit="regen-kit" filter="holding-redstone"/>
    <!-- Player can no longer fly after carrying the flag -->
    <take>
        <kit>
            <fly/>
        </kit>
        <filter>
            <flag-carried>flag</flag-carried>
        </filter>
    </take>
</kits>
```

### Potion Effect Kits (removable)

Potion effects can be applied and removed with a kit. 
See [Potion Effects](/docs/modules/gear/potions) for details about the `<effect>` element.

```xml
<kit>
    <effect duration="10" amplifier="4">resistance</effect>
</kit>
```

### Attribute Modifier Kits (removable)

Attribute modifiers can be applied directly to players through a kit. Modifying attributes in this way,
instead of through an item, is a simple way to ensure that the player cannot avoid the effect of
the modifier. See [Attribute Modifiers](/docs/modules/gear/items#attribute-modifiers) to learn how they are applied to items.

The only way to remove an attribute modifier applied to a player is by removing the kit that applied it. 
A kit cannot affect a modifier applied by a different kit.

**Attribute Operations**

- `add` &#8212; Add amount
- `base` &#8212; Multiply amount by base value and add it
- `multiply` &#8212; Multiply by amount

</kit>
```

### Knockback Reduction Kit (removable)

Reduce (or increase) the knockback players receive when they have this kit applied.
