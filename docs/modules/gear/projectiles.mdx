title: Custom Projectiles
---

Custom projectile types can be defined and applied to items in [Kits](/docs/modules/gear/kits).
These items effectively become either weapons that shoot the custom projectile,
or the item form of the custom projectile itself.

#### Projectiles Element

| Element | Description |
|---|---|
| `<projectiles> </projectiles>` | Node containing the custom projectile definitions. |

| Sub-elements || Value/Children |
|---|---|---|
| `<projectile> </projectile>` | A custom projectile definition. | <span className="badge badge--secondary">Projectile Sub-elements</span> |

#### Projectile Attributes

| Attribute | Description | Value | Default |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | <span className="badge badge--danger">Required</span>Unique identifier used to reference this projectile from other places in the XML. | <span className="badge badge--primary">String</span> |
| `name` | The display name of this projectile, used in "shot by" messages, etc. | <span className="badge badge--primary">String</span> |
| `throwable` | Items are consumed when using them to shoot this projectile (making them more like grenades than guns). | <span className="badge badge--primary">true/false</span> | true |
| `projectile` | The entity this projectile is materialized as. | [Entity Type](/docs/reference/entities/entity-types) | <span className="badge badge--secondary">Arrow</span> |
| `damage` | The amount of damage this projectile deals. | <span className="badge badge--primary">Half-hearts</span> | 0.0 |
| `velocity` | The speed at which the projectile moves. | <span className="badge badge--primary">Meters/tick</span> | 1.0 |
| `click` | The click action that fires the projectile. | `right`,<br />`left`,<br />or `both` | `both` |
| `effects` | The potion effects to apply to players hit by this projectile. | [Potion Effect](/docs/modules/gear/potions) |
| `destroy-filter` | <span className="badge badge--secondary" title="Can be this attribute or a sub-element.">Property</span>Filter if/what blocks get destroyed when hit with this projectile. | [Filter](/docs/modules/mechanics/filters) | `never` |
| `cooldown` | The minimum time between each firing of this projectile. | [Time Period](/docs/reference/misc/time-periods) |
| `precise` | Whether the path of a thrown projectile should be precise in hitting a target.<br />*This is only applicable if the projectile is `Fireball`, `LargeFireball`, `SmallFireball`, or `WitherSkull`.* | <span className="badge badge--primary">true/false</span> | true |

##### Projectile Sub-elements

| Element | Description | Value/Children |
|---|---|---|
| `<destroy-filter>` | <span className="badge badge--secondary" title="Can be this sub-element or an attribute.">Property</span>Filter if/what blocks get destroyed when hit with this projectile. | [Filters](/docs/modules/mechanics/filters) |
| `<effect>` | A potion effect to apply to players hit by this projectile. | [Potion Effects](/docs/modules/gear/potions) |

```xml
<!-- Create the projectile "lazer" -->
<projectiles>
    <projectile
        id="lazer"
        name="lazer"
        projectile="Snowball"
        velocity="3.5"
        damage="50"
        throwable="false"
        cooldown="5s"/>
</projectiles>
<!-- Apply the projectile to an item -->
<kits>
    <kit id="lazer-kit">
        <item projectile="lazer" name="`alazer gun" material="stick"/>
    </kit>
</kits>
```

### Modifying Bow Projectiles

Bows can be modified to shoot a different projectile at a custom speed.
The PGM plugin will calculate the damage the projectile does using the same formula as Minecraft does for arrows.
This means that a flying fish with a velocity of 40 will almost certainly kill you.
Projectiles can also have custom [potion effects](/docs/modules/gear/potions) which are applied to the target when it is hit.

**Note:** You can currently only modify all bow projectiles, this means no normal and custom bow at the same time.

| Element | Description | Value/Children |
|---|---|---|
| `<modifybowprojectile>`<br />`</modifybowprojectile>` | Node containing the modify bow projectile settings. | <span className="badge badge--secondary">Bow Projectile Sub-elements</span> |

| Sub-elements |||
|---|---|---|
| `<projectile> </projectile>` | The entity to use as the bows projectile. | [Projectile Type](/docs/modules/gear/projectiles#custom-projectile-types) |
| `<velocityMod> </velocityMod>` | The velocity modifier of the bows projectile. | <span className="badge badge--primary">Number</span> |
| `<potion> </potion>` | A potion effect to apply to players hit by the bow projectile. | [Potion Effect](/docs/modules/gear/potions) |
| `<pickup-filter> </pickup-filter>` | A filter to determine which players can pick up arrows. | [Filter](/docs/modules/mechanics/filters) |

Examples

```xml
<modifybowprojectile>
    <projectile>EnderPearl</projectile>
    <velocityMod>2.5</velocityMod>
    <!-- Projectile potion effect -->
    <potion duration="5" amplifier="1">poison</potion>
</modifybowprojectile>
<modifybowprojectile>
    <potion duration="8" amplifier="1">wither</potion>
</modifybowprojectile>
```

### Custom Projectile Types

All of the following projectiles in this table are guaranteed to work.
Some projectiles such as `WitherSkull` travel very fast by default and may need `<velocityMod>` to reduce the speed.

| Working Entity Types |
|---|
| `Arrow` |
| `Boat` |
| `Egg` |
| `EnderPearl` |
| `FallingBlock` |
| `Fireball` |
| `Firework` |
| `LargeFireball` |
| `SmallFireball` |
| `Snowball` |
| `ThrownExpBottle` |
| `WitherSkull` |
| `TNTPrimed` |
