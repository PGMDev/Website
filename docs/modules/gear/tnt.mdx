You can modify TNT explosion and placing behavior with this module.
Destruction of terrain can be easily disabled with the `<blockdamage>` element.
If it is set to `false`, the `<yield>` element will have no effect since there will not be any block drops.
TNT damage can be further limited with the [disable damage module](/docs/modules/mechanics/damage#disable-damage).

By default, dispensers containing TNT will ignite their TNT when exploded.
This behavior can be customized with the `<dispenser-tnt-limit>` and `<dispenser-tnt-multiplier>` elements,
setting either of these to `0` will disable it.

If licensing is enabled, only players with a TNT license can use TNT.
This license is revoked if a player kills too many of their teammates using TNT.
