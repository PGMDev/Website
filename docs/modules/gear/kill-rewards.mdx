The Kill Rewards module allows players to get items or a kit when they kill a player.
A kill reward can contain either individual items, kits or references to kits.
The reward can optionally filter which players are eligible to receive the reward, or when/where the reward is active.

This module can, for example, be used to give upgrades to players by giving them gold ingots.
Then, once they have collected enough ingots, they can craft armor, purchase items from a [shop](/docs/modules/gear/shops), or use the ingots as [redeemables](/docs/modules/objectives/scoring#redeemables) for a scorebox, etc.
