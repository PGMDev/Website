The potion `<effect>` element can be used in a kit to apply potion effects directly to a player or used to give a custom effect to a [potion bottle item](/docs/modules/gear/items#potions).

Duration specifies how long the potion will last, and amplifier determines what level / how strong the potion is.
The effect type is specified by its [Minecraft ID](/docs/reference/items/potions#potion-names--colors).
Effect IDs should be specified without their `minecraft:` prefix.

##### Effect Element

| Element | Description | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `<effect> </effect>` | A potion effect. | [Status Effect ID](/docs/reference/items/potions)

##### Effect Attributes

| Attribute | Description | Value | Default |
|---|---|---|---|
| `duration` | Duration of the effect. | [Time Period](/docs/reference/misc/time-periods) | `oo`<br />(forever) |
| `amplifier` | Strength of the effect. The value matches what is displayed to the player in-game, so the first tier of potions have amplifier 1. | <span className="badge badge--primary">Number</span> | 1 |
| `ambient` | Disables potion particles on an potion when set to true.<br />*`potion-particles` must be enabled to use this feature.* | <span className="badge badge--primary">true/false</span> | false |

<effect duration="900" amplifier="1">jump_boost</effect>

<effect duration="2" amplifier="10">damage_resistance</effect>
```
