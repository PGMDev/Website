title: Mob Spawning
---

By default, PGM disables all mob spawning. The mobs module allows this behavior to be customized to allow spawning of specific mobs.
This module makes use of the [`<spawn>`, `<mob>` and `<entity>` filters](/docs/modules/mechanics/filters#entity-filters) to only allow specific mobs to spawn.
Mob spawns can also be filtered against any other filter type, including regions.

| Element | Description |
|---|---|
| `<mobs> </mobs>` | Node containing the custom mob spawning filters. |

| Attributes || Value/Children |
|---|---|---|
| `filter` | <span className="badge badge--secondary" title="Can be either this sub-element or an attribute.">Property</span><span className="badge badge--danger">Required</span>Filter what mobs can spawn when and where. | [Filters](/docs/modules/mechanics/filters) |

##### Mob Spawning Filter Matchers

| Element | Description | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `<spawn> </spawn>` | Filter the reason a mob is being spawned. | [Spawn Reason](/docs/reference/entities/spawn-reasons) |
| `<mob> </mob>` | The mob to filter for. | [Creature Type](/docs/reference/entities/entity-types#creature-types) |
| `<entity> </entity>` | The entity to filter for. | [Entity Type](/docs/reference/entities/entity-types) |
