### Build Height

A world's maximum build height can be set using the `maxbuildheight` element.
Once a player tries to build past the set maximum build height, they will be prompted with a message stating that they can not build past the playing field.

```xml
<maxbuildheight>64</maxbuildheight>
```

### Terrain

A world's terrain generator can be modified to use a specific seed, world and/or whether the vanilla chunk generator is used. 
By default a new random seed is generated for each match, unless one is specified in the seed attribute.

When using the vanilla generator, the default Minecraft terrain generator will be used instead of generating null chunks.
The specific world generation rules such as flat worlds, etc., can be changed by editing the world's `level.dat` file with a NBT editor.
The `RandomSeed` value in the level data file is not used.

Any chunks not in the world's `region/` folder will be generated according to the Minecraft chunk generation rules.
This means that only the terrain that you have modified needs to be saved with the world.

<div className="table-container">
  | Element | Description |
  |---|---|
  | `<terrain />` | A node defining properties for this world's generator. |
</div>

##### Terrain Attributes

<div className="table-container">
  | Attribute | Description | Value | Default |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | `vanilla` | Specify if this world is uses the vanilla or null chunk generator. | <span className="badge badge--primary">true/false</span> | false |
  | `seed` | The world's seed that determines how the world is generated. | <span className="badge badge--primary">String</span> |
  | `environment` | The world's dimension type.<br />**Note:** Worlds with `the end` environment are not supported. | `normal`<br />`nether` | `normal` |
  | `pre-match-physics` | <span className="badge badge--danger" title="This feature once existed, but has not been re-implemented in modern versions of PGM.">N/A</span>Allow physics events, such as water flowing, before the match starts. | <span className="badge badge--primary">true/false</span> | false |
</div>

```xml
<!-- Make a vanilla world with the seed 'qwerty' -->
<terrain vanilla="true" seed="qwerty"/>

<!-- Make the world Nether-like. The 'region' folder must be renamed to 'DIM-1' for this to work. -->
<terrain environment="nether"/>
```

### Internal Maps

Maps that are entirely indoors or underground can use the `internal` attribute on the [main map element](/docs/modules/general/main)
to prevent observers from accidentally teleporting on top of the map with the compass tool.
In order for this to work, the exterior of the map must be completely filled in with solid blocks,
all the way up to the maximum build height.

See [Main Map Element](/docs/modules/general/main)
