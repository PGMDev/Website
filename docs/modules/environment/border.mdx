title: World Border
---

The world border module uses the default Minecraft world border and allows customization of its size, position, and behavior. 
Only one world border definition can be active at a time.

Attributes for multiple world borders can be applied for all borders by specifying them in the root `<world-borders>` element.

<div className="table-container">
  | Element | Description |
  |---|---|
  | `<world-borders> </world-borders>` | Node containing all the defined world borders. |

  | Sub-elements || Value/Children |
  |---|---|---|
  | `<world-border>` | A single world border. | <span className="badge badge--secondary">World Border Sub-elements</span> |
</div>

### Examples

```xml
<world-borders center="6.5, -36.5">
    <!-- Typical time-based shrinking border. Starts at 200 meters when the match loads. -->
    <!-- After 5 minutes, it starts shrinking, until it is 20 meters wide at 15 minutes. -->
    <world-border size="200"/>
    <world-border size="20" after="5m" duration="10m"/>
</world-borders>

<!-- Borders can be controlled with filters (and will update dynamically). This is -->
<!-- roughly how you would move a deadly border depending on which team controls a hill -->
<world-borders size="50" damage="20">
    <world-border center="30, 0">
        <when>
            <objective team="red-team">control-point</objective>
        </when>
    </world-border>
    <world-border center="-30, 0">
        <when>
            <objective team="blue-team">control-point</objective>
        </when>
    </world-border>
</world-borders>
