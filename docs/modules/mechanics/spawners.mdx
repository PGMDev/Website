The `<spawners>` module provides an easy way of spawning items and splash potions into the world, without using actual spawner blocks with NBT editors.

The module uses the same syntax as [Kits](/docs/modules/gear/kits) to
define items and makes use of a specific [region](/docs/modules/mechanics/regions) to spawn them in.

:::info
Currently, only dropped items and splash potions are supported by this module.
Other types of entities may be supported in the future.

<div className="table-container">
  | Element | Description |
  |---|---|
  | `<spawners> </spawners>` | Node containing all defined spawners used in this map. |

  | Sub-elements || Value/Children |
  |---|---|---|
  | `<spawner> </spawner>` | An individual spawner. | <span className="badge badge--secondary">Spawner Sub-elements</span> |

#### Spawner Attributes

<div className="table-container">
  | Attribute | Description | Value | Default |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | `spawn-region` | <span className="badge badge--danger">Required</span>The region in which to spawn the target entities. | [Region](/docs/modules/mechanics/regions) |
  | `player-region` | <span className="badge badge--danger">Required</span>The region used to determine whether the spawner is actively spawning entities. At least 1 player must be in this region for the spawner to be active. | [Region](/docs/modules/mechanics/regions) |
  | `max-entities` | A limit of how many entities this spawner can have spawned at once. | <span className="badge badge--primary">Number</span> | `oo` (infinity) |
  | `delay` | Interval in between spawning attempts. | [Time Period](/docs/reference/misc/time-periods) | 10s |
  | `min-delay` | Used to randomize the spawn interval. Combine this with `max-delay` to create random intervals in between two values.<br />*Cannot be combined with `delay`.* | [Time Period](/docs/reference/misc/time-periods) | `delay` |
  | `max-delay` | Used to randomize the spawn interval. Combine this with `min-delay` to create random intervals in between two values.<br />*Cannot be combined with `delay`.* | [Time Period](/docs/reference/misc/time-periods) | `delay` |
  | `filter` | Filter to further control spawn conditions, will return true if at least one player in `player-region` meets criteria. | [Filter](/docs/modules/mechanics/filters) |
</div>

#### Spawner Sub-elements

<div className="table-container">
  | Element | Description | Value |
  |---|---|---|
  | `<item> </item>` | An item that will be dropped in the `spawn-region`. | [Item](/docs/modules/gear/items) |

### Examples

This will spawn golden swords (in stacks of 1) in the red base, provided there is at least 1 person in that base.
The swords will spawn in ramdom intervals of 2s - 10s.
The <label>filter</label> insures that only players on the red team can trigger the spawner.

```xml
<spawners>
    <spawner spawn-region="red-base" player-region="red-base" max-entities="50" min-delay="2s" max-delay="10s" filter="only-red">
        <item amount="1" name="`6Golden Sword" material="gold sword"/>
    </spawner>
</spawners>
```

This will spawn a single splash potion that gives players Absorption III, Speed II and Jump Boost II.
The speed and jump boost effects will both last 10 seconds and aborbtion will last 60 seconds.
The `damage` attribute will give the potion a red appeareance based on
[Potion Values](/docs/reference/items/potions#potion-names--colors).

```xml
<spawners>
    <spawner spawn-region="spawner" player-region="spawner-area" delay="2s">
        <potion duration="10" amplifier="2" damage="5">
            <effect amplifier="3" duration="60">absorption</effect>
            <effect>speed</effect>
            <effect>jump_boost</effect>
        </potion>
    </spawner>
</spawners>
```
