title: Tracking Compass
---

The Tracking Compass module allows you to override the vanilla compass behavior by pointing
it to a player of interest. In addition, you can control how the compass selects the target to track.

#### Compass Element

<div className="table-container">
  | Element | Description |
  |---|---|
  | `<compass> </compass>` | Node containing all compass properties used in this map. |

  | Sub-element ||
  |---|---|
  | `<player>` | An individual compass property pointing to the nearest player passing a filter. |
  | `<flag>` | An individual compass property pointing to a specific flag. |
</div>

##### Compass Attributes

<div className="table-container">
  | Attribute | Description | Value | Default |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | `order` | When using `DEFINITION_ORDER`, the compass targets first matching target. When using `CLOSEST`, the compass goes through all matching targets and chooses the one closest to the player. | `DEFINITION_ORDER`<br />`CLOSEST` |
  | `show-distance` | Show the distance between the compass holder and tracked player in meters. | <span className="badge badge--primary">true/false</span> | false |
</div>

##### Player/Flag Attribute

<div className="table-container">
  | Attribute | Description | Value | Default |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | `filter` | Filters who should be tracked by the compass. | [Filter](/docs/modules/mechanics/filters) |
  | `holder-filter` | Filters out what compass targets can be eligible for what players, e.g. a team targets a different flag than the other team. | [Filter](/docs/modules/mechanics/filters) |
  | `name` | The title name that describes the tracked flag or player's role, e.g. "Wool Carrier." | <span className="badge badge--primary">Formatted Text</span> |
  | `show-player` | Show the tracked player's username to the compass holder.<br />**Note:** This is only applicable to `<player>` sub-element. | <span className="badge badge--primary">true/false</span> | false |
</div>
