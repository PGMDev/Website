---

Portals teleport a player that enters the specified region to an exact location, by a certain offset amount or to a random location inside a region.

The position and direction attributes of a portal are relative to the players location and where they are looking. 
Prefix these values with an at symbol `@` to specify absolute values. 
Portals can be restricted to certain teams by defining their filter attribute.

Portals respond to any player move event, this allows almost instant teleportation as soon as the player matches the portals filter.

:::tip
Copy the yaw and pitch from the [Debug screen (`F3`)](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Debug_screen) in Minecraft (the `Facing: Direction (Axis) (Yaw/Pitch)` line).

### Examples

```xml
<portals>
    <!-- Moves the player to exactly X:10 Y:8 Z:45, pitch & yaw remain unchanged -->
    <portal x="@10" y="@8" z="@45">
        <region>
            <cuboid min="-56,33,-1" max="-55,35,2"/>
        </region>
    </portal>

    <!-- Adds 12 to the players Z position, turning them to face east and 10Â° up -->
    <portal z="12" pitch="@10" yaw="@-90">
        <region>
            <cuboid min="-56,33,-1" max="-55,35,2"/>
        </region>
    </portal>

    <!-- Teleport the player from portal-entrance to a random point inside portal-exit -->
    <portal region="portal-entrance" destination="portal-exit"/>

    <!-- Teleports players on the Red Team from score-box to red-spawn, facing west -->
    <portal filter="only-red" yaw="@90" region="score-box" destination="red-spawn"/>
</portals>
```

## Dynamic Portals

Dynamic portals are portals that use [Dynamic Filters](/docs/modules/mechanics/filters#dynamic-filters) to determine who is allowed entrance to a portal.
Dynamic portals will always track when a condition is met, rather than standard portals, which can only track when a condition is met at the moment a player enters the portal.
This means that dynamic portals can, for example, **immediately** teleport players 10 minutes into a match.

In this example, the dynamic portal will teleport red players inside the `red-rear` region
to the `red-front` region five minutes into the match. Red players who enter and remain in the region
before the five minutes will still be teleported.

```xml
<portals>
    <!-- A one-way (entrance to destination) Dynamic Portal -->
    <!-- forward takes a dynamic filter as input -->
    <portal forward="dynamic-filter-red" destination="red-front"/>
</portals>
<filters>
    <all id="dynamic-filter-red">
        <team>red-team</team>
        <time>5m</time>
        <!-- The entrance region is described inside the filter -->
        <region id="red-rear"/>
    </all>
</filters>
<regions>
    <cuboid id="red-rear" min="10,20,30" max="15,25,35"/>
    <cuboid id="red-front" min="50,20,30" max="55,25,35"/>
</regions>
```
