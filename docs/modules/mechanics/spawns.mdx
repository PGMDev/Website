title: Spawns
---

The spawns module is required in a complete map XML because it specifies where players and observers can spawn. 
Default and observer spawns are defined with the `<default>` element and all other spawns in `<spawn>` elements. 
Only one default spawn element may be defined per map.

Multiple spawns from the same team can be grouped inside of a single `<regions>` element inside `<spawns team="team-id">`. 
Spawn positions are picked randomly inside of the defined regions. 
Since PGM will not validate the spawn position by default, regions should be checked to make sure that they don't intersect with solid objects or are mid-air. 
Spawns can also be defined with the `safe="true"` attribute, PGM will then check that the player spawns on a solid object and not midair.

The regions element accepts more than one region or region area. 
If they are not inside a `<union>` element one region will be picked at random for each spawn event.

Respawn behavior such as delays, etc. can be customized with the [respawn](#respawn-module) module.

## Respawn Module

The respawn module allows the map creator to adjust the respawn time and if players are automatically respawned. 
For maps that may require instant respawn, you can set the delay to `0s` and auto to `true`.

To allow players to spawn at a bed set the `bed` attribute to true. 
Players spawning at beds will not spawn with a kit, even if there is one specified. 
If a player has a bed spawn location set, it overrides all other spawn regions for that player.

<div className="table-container">
  | Element | Description |
  |---|---|
  | `<respawn/>` | Node specifying the default respawn settings for this map. |
  | `<respawns>` | Node specifying multiple respawn options for this map. |
</div>
