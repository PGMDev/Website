### Friendly Fire

Allows teammates to kill each other. Arrows will be absorbed if they hit a teammate.

```xml
<friendlyfire>on</friendlyfire> <!-- Defaults to off -->
```

Refunds arrows blocked by teammates from non-infinity bows.

```xml
<friendlyfirerefund>off</friendlyfirerefund> <!-- Defaults to on -->
```

### Difficulty

The difficulty level can be set to `peaceful`, `easy`, `normal`, or `hard`. The default is `hard`.

```xml
<difficulty>easy</difficulty> <!-- Defaults to hard -->
```

### Hunger

Specify if a player can starve to death, usually used with the difficulty setting.
This can also be accomplished with the [`naturalRegeneration` gamerule](/docs/modules/mechanics/gamerules).

```xml
<hunger>
    <depletion>off</depletion>
</hunger>
```

### Damage Filtering

This module is used to filter when or if damage is applied to entities.
Its contents can be a filter or combination of filters.
It doesn't have to be `<allow>` and `<deny>` at the top level but that's usually what you want.
Regions can also be used since they are filters that filter for a location.

_Examples_

```xml
<damage>
    <deny>
        <cause>explosion</cause>
    </deny>
</damage>
```

```xml
<!-- Deny damage events where the attacker is on the red team -->
<damage>
    <deny>
        <attacker>
            <team>red</team>
        </attacker>
    </deny>
</damage>
```

```xml
<!-- Deny fall damage for players using the Eagle class -->
<damage>
    <deny>
        <all>
            <class>eagle</class>
            <cause>fall</cause>
        </all>
    </deny>
</damage>
```

### Disable Damage

Use this module to disable damage from specific causes.

While almost every form of damage can be disabled safely, it is recommended that you do **not** disable `VOID` damage.

#### Disable Damage Element

<div className="table-container">
  | Element | Description |
  |---|---|
  | `<disabledamage> </disabledamage>` | Node containing the disabled damage types. |
  
  | Sub-elements || Value/Children |
  |---|---|---|
  | `<damage> </damage>` | The damage type that is disabled. | [Damage Cause](#damage-causes) |
</div>

#### Damage Attributes
<div className="table-container">
  | Attribute | Description | Value |
  |---|---|---|
  | `attacker-action` | The action to trigger for the attacker. | [Action ID](/docs/modules/mechanics/actions-triggers) |
  | `victim-action` | The action to trigger for the victim. | [Action ID](/docs/modules/mechanics/actions-triggers) |
</div>

_Example_

```xml
<disabledamage>
    <!-- Disable fall damage -->
    <damage>fall</damage>
</disabledamage>
```

```xml
<!-- Deny explosions & use actions "when-attacking" and "when-damaged" -->
<damage attacker-action="when-attacking" victim-action="when-damaged">
    <deny>
        <cause>explosion</cause>
    </deny>
</damage>
```

#### Block Explosion Attributes

The `BLOCK_EXPLOSION` damage cause has several extended attributes to customize who/what gets damaged. Only attributes with `false` as the value need to be explicitly defined since all attributes default to `true`.

<div className="table-container">
  | Attribute | Description | Value | Default |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | `ally` | Damage to players on the same team as the person that caused the explosion. | <span className="badge badge--primary">true/false</span> | true |
  | `self` | Damage to the person that caused the explosion. | <span className="badge badge--primary">true/false</span> | true |
  | `enemy` | Damage to players not on the same team as the person that caused the explosion. | <span className="badge badge--primary">true/false</span> | true |
  | `other` | Any other damage caused by the explosion. | <span className="badge badge--primary">true/false</span> | true |
</div>

_Example_

```xml
<disabledamage>
    <!-- TNT damages enemies and self, but not teammates -->
    <damage ally="true" self="false" enemy="false" other="false">block explosion</damage>
</disabledamage>
```

### Damage Causes

The following damage causes can be used in the disable damage module.
These causes do not need to be capitalized or contain underscores, i.e., `FIRE_TICK` and `fire tick` will both work.

<div className="table-container">
  | Name | Description |
  |---|---|
  | `CONTACT` | Damage caused when an entity contacts a block such as a Cactus. |
  | `ENTITY_ATTACK` | Damage caused when an entity attacks another entity. |
