title: Players (free-for-all)
---

The players module is the basis for all team-less gamemodes, such as [Free for All (FFA)](/docs/modules/objectives/other#free-for-all), Ultra Hardcore (UHC), or Survival Games-style matches.
This module is not limited to matches focused on combat,
it can also be used in combat-less game modes where players have to collect specific items, etc.
Win conditions are set by using the score and time limit modules.

:::warning
This gamemode is not compatible with the Teams module!
