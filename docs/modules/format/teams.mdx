title: Teams

This module is used to specify the teams used in the match and what their attributes are.
Matches without teams can be setup with the [Players](/docs/modules/format/players) module.

The soft player limit for each team is set with the `max=""` attribute and the hard limit with `max-overfill`. 
If max overfill is not explicitly defined, the default will be set to 25% over the maximum team size. 
Players will not be able to join teams once the max overfill team size is reached.

The team's name is specified inside the `<team>` element. 
The name should be kept as short as possible and not contain "Team", for example, "Azure" and not "Azure Team".
A team's `plural` attribute specifies if the team name is plural, e.g. "Attackers"; PGM will use this to pick appropriate win messages, etc. 
The `show-name-tags` attribute specifies who can see player name tags, this only applies to players, observers will always see all name tags.

<div className="table-container">
  | Element | Description |
  |---|---|
  | `<teams> </teams>` | The teams node, containing all the individual teams. |

  | Sub-elements || Value |
  |---|---|---|
  | `<team> </team>` | A single team node containing the team's name. | <span className="badge badge--primary">String</span> |

  | `max` | The maximum players for this team, normal players cannot join the team once it reaches this size.<br />*Premium players may join over this limit until `max-overfill` is reached.* | <span className="badge badge--primary">Number</span> |

### Examples

```xml
<teams>
    <team id="red-team" color="dark red" max="50" max-overfill="70">Red</team>
    <team id="blue-team" color="blue" max="50" max-overfill="70">Blue</team>
</teams>
```

The total maximum number of players in the example given above is 100, however, the max overfill will allow up to 140 players. 
Servers currently have a player limit of 150, so 100 players in total would allow 50 observers, or 10 observers if teams are at max overfill.
