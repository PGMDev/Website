title: Broadcasts
---

The broadcast module allows you to send a message to all players at any given point in the match.
Inside the broadcast tag you may specify either a `<alert>` or a `<tip>` message tag with an `after=""` attribute.
This attribute is required and specifies how long after the match is started the broadcast is shown.

The text in broadcasts can be formatted by using [Text Formatting](/docs/reference/misc/formatting).

:::note
This module should **only** be used to show important
information that is **specific** and **unique** to the map.
It should not be used for generic server-related messages.
