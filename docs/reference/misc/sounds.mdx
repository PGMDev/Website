title: Sound Presets
---

Sounds are used to draw a player's attention to certain events on a map. 
PGM comes with several preset sounds that can be quickly used for scenarios.
It can be used in combination with other actions, as defined in [Actions &amp; Triggers](/docs/modules/mechanics/actions-triggers#sound-attributes).
