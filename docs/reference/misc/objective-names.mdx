title: Objective Names
---

A few objective names specified in `name=` can be automatically translated to users who connect to the server
using a language other than English in their client. They can be used by themselves or with other words
(*i.e. Antenna A*). Names are case senstitive.

<div className="table-container">
  | Translatable Objective Names |
  |---|
  | `Antenna` |
  | `Base` |
  | `Core` |
  | `Engine` |
  | `Flag` |
  | `Inhibitor` |
  | `Monument` |
  | `Orb` |
  | `Pillar` |
  | `Reactor` |
  | `Ship` |
  | `Tower` |
  | `Wool` |
</div>

## Descriptor Patterns

Descriptor Patterns are also supported, which can be used in addition to the Objective Patterns.
Multiple descriptor patterns can be used at once (_ie Bottom Left Monument_).
Names are also case senstitive.
