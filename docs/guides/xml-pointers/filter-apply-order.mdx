After proto `1.3.3` and above, the order that you [apply](/docs/modules/mechanics/regions#applying-things-to-regions) filters to regions affects their behavior.
Here is an example.

Let us start out with a basic filter that **denies** everything **except** TNT.

```xml
<all id="only-tnt">
    <material>tnt</material>
</all>
```

Now let us apply this filter to `Region A`, and also apply a filter to `Region B` that denies all blocks.

```xml
<apply region="region-a" block="only-tnt"/>
<apply region="region-b" block="never"/>
```

However, there is one slight complication. `Region B` is inside of `Region A`.
So which filter will override the other? This is where the apply order comes in handy.

<div className="text--center">
  <ImageSwitcher alt="An overview of two sample regions and a depiction of two possible apply orders that affect how the regions operate."
    lightImageSrc="/img/guides/apply-order.png"
    darkImageSrc="/img/guides/apply-order-dark.png"
  />
</div>

The order that you put the `<apply>` tags can change the outcome when something gets filtered.
In the previous example, the `only-tnt` filter would always override the `never` filter since it is above it.
The apply for `region B` won't get checked since it overlaps completely with `region A` and `region A` never returns abstain.

If we changed the order of the filters:

```xml
<apply region="region-b" block="never"/>
<apply region="region-a" block="only-tnt"/>
```

Now you cannot place blocks in `Region B`, but outside of it in `Region A` you can only place TNT blocks.

Although this may not be an issue for many maps such as a Blitz map or a TDM,
this is a crucial concept for many DTC/DTM/CTW maps that use the `<void/>` filter.
Usually it's best to have the `<void/>` filter at the lowest priority (at the bottom of the list).
