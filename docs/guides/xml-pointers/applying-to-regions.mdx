title: Using Filters and Regions
---

Regions define areas that can later be applied to [Filters](/docs/modules/mechanics/filters) and other modules.
Understanding how modules, regions and filters work together is important to make critical mechanics for a map.

## Creating a Filter

Creating a [Filter](/docs/modules/mechanics/filters) allows us to put restrictions on certain events.
We want to stop players from entering their enemy's spawn region, usually to prevent spawnkilling.
Our goal is to filter players that are entering a region, so we will make basic filters that matches for
players on a certain team.

```xml
<filters>
    <!-- Filter will pass ALLOW if player is on Red Team -->
    <team id="only-red">red-team</team>
    <team id="only-blue">blue-team</team>
</filters>
```

## Creating a Region

Creating a [Region](/docs/modules/mechanics/regions) involves certain world coordinates.
In this example, we will create simple `<cuboid/>` regions inside a `<union>`, which we will save with IDs
which we can reference for later use.

```xml
<regions>
    <union id="spawns">
        <cuboid id="red-spawn" min="20,0,55" max="40,10,75"/>
        <cuboid id="blue-spawn" min="10,0,-55" max="30,10,-75"/>
    </union>
</regions>
```

## Applying a Filter to a Region

Applying filters to a region is done inside the `<regions>` module.
When we make our `<apply/>` module, we can use the IDs in our region and filter to reference them as a variable.
Out of the various [events](/docs/modules/mechanics/regions#apply-element-attributes),
we will use the `enter` event.
When a player enters `red-spawn`, we want to make sure that only players on the red team are able to enter it.
So we apply our `only-red` filter to players that are entering it.

```xml
<filters>
    <team id="only-red">red-team</team>
    <team id="only-blue">blue-team</team>
</filters>
<regions>
    <union id="spawns">
        <cuboid id="red-spawn" min="20,0,55" max="40,10,75"/>
        <cuboid id="blue-spawn" min="10,0,-55" max="30,10,-75"/>
    </union>
    <!-- checks only-red if a player is allowed to enter -->
    <apply region="red-spawn" enter="only-red"/>
    <apply region="blue-spawn" enter="only-blue"/>
</regions>
```

## Applying things to multiple regions

Typically we want to prevent players from placing or breaking any blocks in spawn, but
we have two spawn regions defined in our XML, and both need spawn protection.
The `<union>` element using the ID `spawns` combines the two team spawns into a single region.
Using `spawns` with `<apply/>` will let us apply a filter to both regions.
We will use the built-in `never` filter, which denies everything.
This XML protects spawn from being damaged by players, TNT, mobs, etc and prevents
players from entering their enemy's spawn room, but can still safely enter their own.

```xml
<filters>
    <team id="only-red">red-team</team>
    <team id="only-blue">blue-team</team>
</filters>
<regions>
    <union id="spawns">
        <cuboid id="red-spawn" min="20,0,55" max="40,10,75"/>
        <cuboid id="blue-spawn" min="10,0,-55" max="30,10,-75"/>
    </union>
    <apply region="red-spawn" enter="only-red"/>
    <apply region="blue-spawn" enter="only-blue"/>
    <!-- denies all block breaking and placing in both red-spawn and blue-spawn -->
    <apply region="spawns" block="never"/>
</regions>
```
