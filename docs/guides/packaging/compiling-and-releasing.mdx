import ImageSwitcher from "@site/src/components/ImageSwitcher.js";

Once your world is cleaned up and pruned, it is ready to be compiled.
To start, add in your `map.xml` file. Then, add in your `map.png` file.
Below is an image of what your map folder should look like:

<ImageSwitcher
  lightImageSrc="/img/guides/compiled-folder.png"
  darkImageSrc="/img/guides/compiled-folder-dark.png"
/>

### The Map XML File

The `map.xml` file is the XML you coded for your map.
This file is essential when it comes to having your map loaded and tested.

Take note of the following coding guidelines when creating your `map.xml` file:

- Verify there are **no tabs in the XML** -- 4 spaces only.
- Verify the main map element and its main elements are not indented.
- Follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org) when deciding the map version.
- Bump the map version if gameplay has changed.
- [Validate](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_validator.asp) the XML to make sure it does not have any syntax errors.

### The Map Image

The `map.png` file displays the image of your map.
The standard resolution for these pictures is `290x246`.
This image should contain a general overview of the map's playing area.
You should use the default resource pack without shaders.

_Image Example_

<div className="row">
  <div className="col col--6">
    <img src="/img/guides/totally-war-2.png" />
  </div>
  <div className="col">
    <img src="/img/guides/rage-quit.png" />
  </div>
</div>

### Compressing the folder to a ZIP file

Before you upload the map, you must compress the folder to a `.zip` format.
Do **not** compress to a `.rar` or any other format.

To compress a folder:

- **Windows:** Right Click > Send To > Compressed Zip
- **macOS:** Right Click > Compress

### Uploading the map

To upload the map, we recommend using [MediaFire](https://www.mediafire.com/), [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/), or creating a [GitHub](https://github.com/) repository.
Additionally, follow any instructions from the Minecraft network of your choice if you wish to submit a map to them.
