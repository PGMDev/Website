title: Cleaning Files
---

Minecraft will generate quite a few files in your world folder when you create a world. 
Most of these files are not needed and by deleting them you can reduce the file size when it comes to uploading your world.

Below is a table which displays all the files that may be generated in your world folder, along with a description and whether or not the file is required.

<div className="table-container">

  | `level.dat` | <span className="badge badge--success">YES</span> | Stores global information about the world such as name and generation type. |
  | `region/*.mca` | <span className="badge badge--success">YES</span> | Contains all the region files of your world.<br />Individual region files using `.mcr` extension should not be included if the world was converted to Anvil. |
