title: Cleaning Files
---

Minecraft will generate quite a few files in your world folder when you create a world. 
Most of these files are not needed and by deleting them you can reduce the file size when it comes to publishing your world.

Below is a table which displays all the files that may be generated in your world folder, along with a description and whether or not the file is required.

| File Name | Required? | Description |
|---|:---:|---|
| `level.dat` | <span className="badge badge--success">YES</span> | Stores global information about the world such as name and generation type. |
| `region/*.mca` | <span className="badge badge--success">YES</span> | Contains all the region files of your world.<br />Individual region files using `.mcr` extension should not be included if the world was converted to Anvil. |
| `entities/*.mca` | <span className="badge badge--warning">DEPENDS</span> | Contains all of the world's entities data. Present in maps generated in Minecraft 1.17 and later.  |
